# “Blessing” the CSS framework

## How to use
Blessing assumes 2 use cases:

### 1. As CSS class library (easier, lightly use)
Blessing has many useful CSS class definitions.
So you just put the following line:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/blessing.css" />
```

in above your stylesheet `<link>`.  
OR  
place this:

```css
@import "path/to/blessing.css";
```
into your CSS


### 2. As Less mixin library (deeper use)
